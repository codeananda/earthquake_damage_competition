0   geo_level_1_id, int
 1   geo_level_2_id,

land_surface_condition - categorical (but object)

# 7-13 inclusive are all object and need to be changed to categorical
# 14-24 inclusive (has_) are all int and need to be changed to binary
# 25 object --> category
# 27-37 (has_) all int --> binary

Are the categories ordered??
