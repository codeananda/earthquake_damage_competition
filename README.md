# This Repo is a Work-in-Progress üèó

I paused work on this project in May 2021 and am in the process of tidying everything up so it can be presented to the world in a nice manner. You are one of the lucky souls who gets to see the repo in its raw form. But this means that not everything is as clean or orderly as it should be.

However, I hope it gives you an idea of how I approached this project and demonstrates my end-to-end data science skills using core libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and LightGBM on tabular data. 

## Libraries Used

For this project, I used Python and the following libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* LightGBM
* H2O.ai
