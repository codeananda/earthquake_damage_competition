# Driven Data - Earthquake Damage Competition - Tabular Data
My entries to Driven Data's tabular ML competition [Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/).

The code is presented as-is. In the near future, I will tidy it up and turn it into a well-written portfolio project meant for an external audience. In the meantime, here is the code and submission files.

## Best Score

As of 01/09/21 my best submission ranks 151 / 4593 - the top 3.5% of all submissions. This was achieved by bagging many LightGBM models together.
